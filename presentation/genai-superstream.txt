Define: Agentics/əˈdʒentɪks/ (noun)
PACT: Proactive, Autonomous, Collaborative, and Targeted 
Proactive 
Anticipating and initiating changes


Autonomous
Operating independently


Targeted
Pursuing defined objectives



Collaborative
Working effectively with other systems or agents
The field of study and engineering practice focused on creating intelligent systems that are:
Origin: Early 21st century: from 'agent' (in the context of artificial intelligence) + '-ics' (denoting a field of study).



Vibe Coding 
Crafting code by feel, balancing functionality with readability, style and project mood
Core Principles
Rapid iteration guided by intuitive feedback
Emphasis on clean, expressive naming and structure
Aligning code style with team culture and project “vibe”
Benefits
Faster prototyping with fewer mental blocks
Code that feels approachable and motivates collaboration
Encourages consistency through shared aesthetic standards

Vibe Coding vs Agentic Engineering
Agentic Engineering and Vibe Coding are different ways to interact, create and develop with AI. 
Vibe Coding
Flow
Fluid and Intuitive
Little Process
Human is the feedback loop
Ideation and Discovery

Agentic Engineering
Structured 
Process Driven
Deep Planning / Test Driven
Machine is feedback loop
Iteration and refinement

THE AGENTIC SPECTRUM 

Introduction to SPARC Methodology
The SPARC Framework is a comprehensive methodology designed to guide the development of robust and scalable applications. 
SPARC stands for Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, and Completion. 
Each step ensures thorough planning, execution, and reflection throughout the project lifecycle.


Install ‘npx create-sparc’


Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP is the new API. Simple, composable, and totally abstracted. It turns any tool into a native function any model can call.
Open standard for LLM-tool integrationSecure, two-way connections between models and external tools
Plug-and-play “USB-C for AI”Any CLI or script becomes a native function in one generate_content call
Zero-friction developer experienceNo hosting, schema work, or glue code, just wrap over stdio or SSE
Unix mindset applied to AISmall, composable tools embedded in the model’s reasoning loop
Built-in guardrailsSandboxing, input validation, and strict command boundaries
