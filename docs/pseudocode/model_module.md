## Usage Example

```python
# Example usage of the model module
from data_module import DataLoader

# Load data
data_loader = DataLoader()
data, target, feature_names, target_names = data_loader.load_iris_dataset()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = data_loader.split_data()

# Train model
trainer = ModelTrainer(model_type="logistic_regression", 
                       model_params={"max_iter": 200})
model = trainer.train(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
metrics = trainer.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']}")

# Create predictor
predictor = Predictor(model, target_names)

# Make prediction
features = [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]
prediction = predictor.predict_species(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

## Interfaces

The Model Module exposes the following interfaces to other modules:

1. `ModelTrainer.train()`: Trains the model on provided data
2. `ModelTrainer.evaluate()`: Evaluates model performance
3. `ModelTrainer.save_model()`: Saves the trained model
4. `ModelTrainer.load_model()`: Loads a saved model
5. `Predictor.predict_species()`: Makes species predictions with probabilities
6. `Predictor.predict_class()`: Makes class predictions
7. `ModelFactory.create_model()`: Creates model instances

## Error Handling

- Invalid model type errors are caught and reported
- Training on invalid data triggers appropriate exceptions
- Prediction with untrained models is prevented
- Invalid feature inputs are validated and rejected
