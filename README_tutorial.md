## Chapter 6: Hands-On Data Engineering

### Project Overview: UK AI Jobs Analysis

We'll build a comprehensive data analysis system that examines how AI is transforming technical jobs in the UK market. This project demonstrates real-world agentic engineering principles.

### Step 1: Initialize the DuckDB Database

DuckDB is our analytical database of choice - think "SQLite for analytics." It's perfect for:
- **Columnar-vectorized processing**: Handles large datasets efficiently
- **Full SQL support**: Complex queries and window functions
- **Format flexibility**: Works with CSV, Parquet, JSON, and more
- **Python integration**: Seamless pandas DataFrame support

Create the database foundation:

```python
# db/init_duckdb.py
import duckdb
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

class JobsDatabase:
    def __init__(self, db_path="db/uk_jobs.duckdb"):
        """Initialize the jobs database with proper schema"""
        self.db_path = db_path
        self.conn = duckdb.connect(db_path)
        
    def initialize_schema(self):
        """Create the jobs table with optimized schema"""
        schema_sql = """
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS jobs (
            job_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
            title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
            company VARCHAR NOT NULL,
            location VARCHAR,
            salary VARCHAR,
            description TEXT,
            ai_impact FLOAT CHECK (ai_impact >= 0 AND ai_impact <= 1),
            date_posted DATE,
            source VARCHAR,
            created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        );
        
        -- Create indexes for better query performance
        CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_company ON jobs(company);
        CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_location ON jobs(location);
        CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_ai_impact ON jobs(ai_impact);
        CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_jobs_date_posted ON jobs(date_posted);
        """
        
        self.conn.execute(schema_sql)
        print("‚úÖ Database schema initialized successfully")
        
    def insert_job(self, job_data):
        """Insert a single job record"""
        insert_sql = """
        INSERT OR REPLACE INTO jobs 
        (job_id, title, company, location, salary, description, ai_impact, date_posted, source)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        """
        self.conn.execute(insert_sql, job_data)
        
    def get_jobs_dataframe(self, query="SELECT * FROM jobs"):
        """Convert query results to pandas DataFrame"""
        return self.conn.execute(query).fetch_df()
        
    def close(self):
        """Close database connection"""
        self.conn.close()

# Initialize your database
if __name__ == "__main__":
    db = JobsDatabase()
    db.initialize_schema()
    print("üöÄ Database ready for agentic data engineering!")
    db.close()
```

### Step 2: Running the Database Setup

```bash
python db/init_duckdb.py
```

### Step 3: Populating with Sample Data

Use the provided script to populate with UK AI jobs data:

```bash
python db/insert_ai_jobs_duckdb.py
```

---

## Chapter 7: Advanced Analytics with DuckDB

### Running Analytics

To run basic analytics and visualizations on the jobs data:

```bash
python db/jobs_analytics_example.py
```

This script will:
1. Load data from the DuckDB database
2. Preprocess the data for machine learning
3. Run simple clustering and trend analysis on AI impact
4. Generate visualizations showing the results

The visualization will be saved as [`db/job_analytics_results.png`](db/job_analytics_results.png).

### Using the CLI Tool

The project includes a command-line tool for quickly reviewing and filtering job data:

```bash
# View all jobs
python scripts/review_uk_jobs.py

# Filter by job title
python scripts/review_uk_jobs.py --title Engineer

# Filter by company
python scripts/review_uk_jobs.py --company Google
```

---

## Chapter 8: Real-World Implementation

### MCP Integration for Data Collection

You can populate the database with UK AI jobs data using the PerplexityAI MCP integration in Roo Code. This approach leverages AI to gather the latest jobs data:

#### Using PerplexityAI MCP

1. First, configure the Composio PerplexityAI MCP in your project by creating an [`mcp.json`](mcp.json) file:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "perplexityai": {
      "url": "mcp.composio/your-key-url",
      "tools": [
        "PERPLEXITYAI_PERPLEXITY_AI_SEARCH"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

2. In Roo Code, interact with the PerplexityAI service to research UK AI jobs data. Ask for structured information about how AI is affecting technical jobs in the UK, specifying that you need job titles, companies, locations, salaries, descriptions, AI impact metrics, posting dates, and sources.

3. Parse the returned data and insert it into the DuckDB database:

```python
import duckdb
import json

# Parse data from PerplexityAI response
perplexity_response = json.loads(perplexity_result)
jobs_data = extract_jobs_from_response(perplexity_response)

# Connect to DuckDB and insert data
con = duckdb.connect('db/uk_jobs.duckdb')
for job in jobs_data:
    con.execute('''
        INSERT OR REPLACE INTO jobs
        (job_id, title, company, location, salary, description, ai_impact, date_posted, source)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
    ''', job)
con.close()
```

---

## Chapter 9: Best Practices and Patterns

### Custom Analytics

You can create custom analytics by combining DuckDB's SQL capabilities with scikit-learn:

```python
from db.init_duckdb import JobsDatabase
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Connect to the database
db = JobsDatabase()

# Query specific data
df = db.get_jobs_dataframe("SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE ai_impact > 0.7")

# Create text features from job descriptions
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=100, stop_words='english')
features = tfidf.fit_transform(df['description'])

# Run clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(features)

# Analyze results
cluster_stats = df.groupby('cluster').agg({
    'ai_impact': ['mean', 'count'],
    'title': lambda x: ', '.join(set(x))[:100]
})

print(cluster_stats)
db.close()
```

### Extending the Database

You can extend the database schema to include additional information:

```python
# Connect to DuckDB
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect('db/uk_jobs.duckdb')

# Add a new column
con.execute('''
    ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN remote_work BOOLEAN;
''')

# Update existing records
con.execute('''
    UPDATE jobs 
    SET remote_work = (location LIKE '%Remote%')
''')

con.close()
```

---

## Chapter 10: Production Deployment

### Integration with Other Systems

The DuckDB database can be integrated with other systems:

```python
# Export to CSV
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect('db/uk_jobs.duckdb')
con.execute('''
    COPY (SELECT * FROM jobs) TO 'exported_jobs.csv' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',');
''')
con.close()

# Export to a different database system
import duckdb
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# Extract from DuckDB
con_duck = duckdb.connect('db/uk_jobs.duckdb')
df = con_duck.execute("SELECT * FROM jobs").fetch_df()
con_duck.close()

# Load into SQLite
con_sqlite = sqlite3.connect('other_system.db')
df.to_sql('jobs', con_sqlite, if_exists='replace', index=False)
con_sqlite.close()
```
